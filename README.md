## My process

### Built with

- Media Queries
- CSS custom properties
- SASS/Gulp workflow
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1. Media Queries

   In order to make the content responsive, I set screen size breakpoints for both desktop and mobile devices. You can also utilize SASS functions and maps to pass variables like "large" or "medium" so you don't have to pass the pixel size everytime.

```scss
$breakpoints-up: (
  "large": "1440px",
  "medium": "870px",
  "small": "375px",
);

@mixin breakpoint($size) {
  @media (min-width: map-get($map: $breakpoints-up, $key: $size)) {
    @content;
  }
}
```

Then utilize the function like so:

```scss
.card {
  max-width: rem(330);
  width: 100%;
  border-radius: 16px;
  background-color: white;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  filter: drop-shadow(0 0 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2));

  @include breakpoint(large) {
    max-width: rem(400);
  }
}
```

2. Pseudo classes

3. & in SCSS

4.

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
